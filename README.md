## Analysis:

### Sales
Total sales for the business amounted to $742K. A regional breakdown shows that the West region led with $252K in sales, followed by the East at $208K, Central at $163K, and the South at $117K.

### Profit
The business recorded a total profit of $18.5K, which is relatively low compared to total sales of $742K. This indicates a high cost structure and a wide gap between revenue and profit, suggesting the need for better cost control and margin optimization.

Regionally, the West generated the highest profit at over $11K, aligning with its leading sales performance. This was followed by the South, which contributed $6K in profit, reinforcing its role as a strong secondary market despite lower sales volume.

### Quantity
Total quantity sold across all regions stood at 8,000 units. The West once again led in performance, recording the highest quantity sold.
However, an interesting discrepancy arises between the South and East regions. Despite the South selling fewer units than the East, it generated more profit.

This could be attributed to several factors, including:
- Higher pricing per unit in the South
- Lower cost of goods sold (COGS) or operational efficiency
- Product mix differences, where the South may have focused on higher-margin items

This variance highlights the importance of not only tracking quantity but also understanding unit economics and product-level profitability across regions.

### Highest sales generating product categories
Across all regions, Chairs emerged as the highest revenue-generating product category, bringing in $328K, followed by Tables. This trend highlights the role of complementary purchasing behavior, where customers often buy related items together—such as chairs with tables—indicating a degree of elasticity in product demand.

Additionally, Bookcases also showed strong performance, suggesting consistent demand for practical, space-enhancing furniture items.

### Top selling city
When analyzing sales by city—independent of regional groupings—New York led with over $75K in revenue, followed by Los Angeles ($54K) and Seattle ($41K).

This city-level performance highlights key urban markets that consistently drive sales, offering potential focal points for targeted marketing, inventory prioritization, and localized growth strategies.

### Sales Distribution by State
A significant portion of the company’s revenue is concentrated in California, which stands out as the top-performing state. It is followed by New York and Texas, indicating that these three states are the company’s primary revenue drivers.

This concentration suggests an opportunity to strengthen market presence in these states while also exploring ways to expand reach in underperforming regions.

### Monthly Sales Trend
The highest sales were recorded in September, November, and December, indicating strong end-of-year performance. However, any clear pattern within the “-ember” months is disrupted by a sharp and unexpected decline in October, making it an outlier that weakens any consistent seasonal inference.

Additionally, sales in the first half of the year were significantly lower, highlighting a heavy reliance on late-year performance. This suggests a potential gap in demand generation or marketing effectiveness during the earlier months, which may need to be addressed to achieve more balanced year-round sales.

However, sales from the first half of the year were terribly low.

### Most used shipping mode
A majority of customers—approximately 59%—opted for Standard Class shipping, which is typically the most cost-effective option. This indicates a strong customer preference for affordability over speed when it comes to delivery.

Following Standard Class, Second Class shipping was the next most preferred option, selected by around 20% of customers. This distribution highlights the importance of maintaining low-cost shipping options, as they appear to align closely with customer expectations and purchasing behavior.

### Shipping Duration 
For the majority of customers, product delivery typically takes 4 to 5 days, with 4 days being the most common delivery window. Only a small fraction of customers (approximately 9%) receive their orders within 1 day, indicating that expedited delivery is relatively rare.

This delivery performance is likely influenced by the proximity between the customer’s location and the distribution warehouse, suggesting that logistical factors such as shipping zones and warehouse coverage play a significant role in delivery speed.

Improving delivery times may require optimizing warehouse locations or expanding regional fulfillment capabilities to bring products closer to key customer clusters.

## Conclusion and Recommendations:

The analysis reveals key patterns in sales performance, product demand, customer preferences, and shipping behavior across regions and time.
Total sales reached $742K, with the West region leading in both revenue and quantity sold, while California, New York, and Texas emerged as top-performing states.

Chairs and Tables were the most purchased categories, pointing to a strong demand for complementary and functional furniture items, with Bookcases also performing well.

New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle were the top revenue-generating cities, highlighting major urban markets as high-opportunity zones.
On a monthly basis, September, November, and December led in sales, while October stood out as a low-performing outlier, disrupting the otherwise strong end-of-year trend.
Most customers preferred Standard Class shipping (59%), prioritizing cost-effectiveness. Delivery typically occurred within 4 to 5 days, with fast (1-day) delivery being rare and likely dependent on geographic proximity to warehouses.

### Key Recommendations

1. Strengthen Q1–Q2 Sales Performance:
- Develop marketing campaigns and promotions to drive demand earlier in the year.
- Analyze product interest by season to spread out sales more evenly across quarters.

2. Leverage High-Performing Cities & States:
- Focus marketing and inventory resources on California, New York, and Texas, with special attention to New York City, LA, and Seattle.
- Explore local partnerships or pop-up strategies to increase brand presence in those cities.
  
3. Capitalize on Product Synergies:
- Bundle complementary items like Chairs and Tables to increase average order value.
- Highlight high-performing categories in campaigns and adjust inventory planning accordingly.

4. Optimize Shipping Strategy:
- Continue offering low-cost shipping tiers, as they align with customer preference.
- Explore opening or utilizing regional fulfillment centers to reduce average delivery time, especially for underserved areas.
  
5. Investigate October Sales Drop:
- Analyze operational or market-related factors that may have caused the October sales dip.
- Consider whether stockouts, promotions, or external factors contributed and apply lessons for future fall campaigns.

6. Enhance Logistics Based on Delivery Patterns:
- Use customer location and warehouse distance data to improve fulfillment mapping.
- Identify where customers frequently experience longer shipping times and address those zones with logistical improvements.
